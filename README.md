# Singular-Value-Decomposition

## Overview

This project implements Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. SVD is a powerful technique used in various applications such as image compression, noise reduction, and collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. This project merely looked at the noise reduction application.

## Features

- **Matrix Decomposition:** Decompose a given matrix into its singular values and singular vectors
- **Image Compression:** Demonstrates the application of SVD in reducing the size of images while preserving essential features.
- **Noise Reduction:** Applies SVD to remove noise from data.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes SVD for building recommendation systems based on user-item interaction matrices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- Requests
